This application requires an Active Wallet linked with a Web Extension for seamless transaction management. We have integrated support for Solana, a fast and secure blockchain, to facilitate easy and efficient transactions.

Solana Blockchain Transactions
Solana Network: The application utilizes the Solana blockchain for transaction processing, leveraging its low fees and high speed.

Web Extension: To interact with the Solana blockchain, the application requires a compatible Web Extension Wallet, such as Phantom, Sollet, or Solflare, which allows users to securely manage their Solana tokens.

Transaction Flow: Users can send, receive, and view their Solana tokens directly within the application once their wallet is connected.

Security: All transactions are securely signed via the wallet and handled through the Solana blockchainâ€™s decentralized network, ensuring safety and privacy.

Make sure to install and set up one of the supported Solana Web Extension wallets to start using the application.
